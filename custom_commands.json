Other games time IGT by reading game bytes, specifically the loading state ones. But we can't do this in bedrock because console and mobile, and we don't have such tool for PC. Only windows has livesplit but we don't have any impostors to program on such garbage viruses like windows 7/10.\n\nThere's also retiming manually IGT, but that will no doubt increas the verification time of each run by 4 times at least, and no one wants that.\n\nThere's also letting people retime themselvves, but it's a really really really bad idea to let others retime their own runs, since they can easily fake the time.\n\nSo no, IGT isn't, and will most likely never, be a thing in this game",
